# Talking Ta√≠no Shaman AI

A local, browser-based AI that simulates a Ta√≠no *behique* (shaman), designed to engage users with poetic and spiritual responses using ChatGPT and ElevenLabs TTS.

---

## üß† What It Does
- Accepts **typed or spoken input** from a user in the browser
- Uses **OpenAI (ChatGPT)** to generate poetic, wisdom-filled replies
- Uses **ElevenLabs** to speak the response aloud using the "Clyde" voice
- Mimics the style and tone of a Ta√≠no shaman, referencing nature, spirits, and ancestral knowledge
